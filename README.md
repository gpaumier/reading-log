# reading-log

A log of what I read. Some day I'll make a nice visualization out of this, probably in the style of [Charles Ibry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ibry)'s train timetables (made popular by [Ã‰tienne-Jules Marey](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3APopular_Science_Monthly_Volume_15.djvu/338)). Keys refer to entries in the associated BibTeX bibliography, which I'm in the process of completing.
